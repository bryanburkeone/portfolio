      <h1>Project Overview</h1>
      <p>This project focuses on enhancing the online shopping experience, particularly within the fashion industry, by addressing the common issue of decision fatigue. Online shoppers are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of product options, making it difficult to efficiently browse, filter, and compare clothing items. Traditional e-commerce platforms typically require users to sift through irrelevant items or open multiple tabs to compare products, leading to a frustrating and cumbersome shopping experience.</p>
      
      <p>Our team set out to solve this problem by designing two innovative features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An AI-powered filtering tool that allows users to quickly narrow down clothing options based on personalized preferences (e.g., style, color, size, occasion).</li>
        <li>An infinite canvas that lets users visually arrange, move, and compare favorited items side by side in a more intuitive, flexible way.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Our ultimate goal was to reduce cognitive overload and improve user satisfaction by creating a streamlined, visually engaging shopping experience that empowers users to make informed decisions with ease.</p>

        <h3>Lower Conversion Rates</h3>

    <h2>Research and Discovery</h2>
    <div class="centered-content">
      <p>
        We conducted surveys with fellow UCSD students, transcribed their responses, and identified
        <strong>key pain points</strong>, particularly decision fatigue, inefficient search, and challenges in product
        comparison. Using these insights, we created a <strong>user journey map</strong> to deepen our understanding of
        the user experience. Informed by <strong>academic research</strong> on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) related to
        interfaces and online shopping, we applied these findings to shape our initial low-fidelity (LoFi) designs.

    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    <div class="centered-paragraph">
      <p>
        Users felt overwhelmed by the number of products, leading to decision fatigue and difficulty narrowing options. The search function was poorly organized, making it hard to find specific items. Shoppers also struggled with side-by-side product comparisons, leading to cognitive overload. From the survey findings, we created a user journey map to pinpoint key pain points at each stage, helping us understand user challenges which guided our design decisions.

    <h2>Ideation and Prototypes</h2>
    <p>After identifying key pain points, our team had clear goals in mind. We wanted to make navigating ecommerce sites faster and more intuitive. We wanted to be able to compare items side by side without multiple tabs and to find clothes that fit specific needs for specific events. To meet these goals, we focused on:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI-powered filtering</strong> to narrow options efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Wardrobe:</strong> Personalized clothing recommendations based on selected items.</li>
        <li><strong>An infinite canvas</strong> for intuitive, side-by-side product comparison.</li>
        <li><strong>An expandable infinite canvas,</strong> allowing users to zoom into subcategories and back out, mimicking in-store navigation and making it easier to navigate large inventories.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Feedback and Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    After presenting the first iteration, we received <strong>mostly positive feedback</strong>, with many students expressing interest in our project. Constructive feedback highlighted potential <strong>confusion with navigation</strong>, including the challenge of remembering the user's location within the site, as well as the <strong>significant resources</strong> and time required for a company to update its current e-commerce platform. Unfortunately, the class ended, and we could no longer dedicate time to the project. However, I continued working on it in my spare time and created a <strong>new iteration</strong> that achieves our original design goals while being <strong>far less resource-intensive</strong> for companies to implement. The <strong>final prototype</strong> is included below. </p>

  <h2>Reflection and Learnings</h2>
  
  <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
  <p>
    One of the key challenges we faced as a team was <em>clearly defining the problems</em> we wanted to address and <em>brainstorming wireframe ideas</em> that effectively tackled those issues. Aligning on the problems and translating them into <em>viable design solutions</em> required strong collaboration and communication. Additionally, coordinating everyone’s schedules to establish a structured design process proved difficult. This lack of alignment and consistency impacted the overall workflow and hindered our ability to maintain a unified approach throughout the project.
  </p>
  
  <h3>What Would You Do Differently?</h3>
  <p>
    In hindsight, I believe crafting <strong>more robust survey questions</strong> that elicited deeper user responses would have provided us with <strong>actionable insights</strong> to guide more informed design decisions. Additionally, establishing a <strong>clear and collaborative design process</strong> early on would have ensured better alignment and more effective contributions from the team. With stronger feedback and a structured approach to ideation, we could have collaborated more efficiently to develop <strong>more polished and user-centered solutions</strong>.
